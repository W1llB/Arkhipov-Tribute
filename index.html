          <h3 id="headline"> Here's a brief overview of Arkhipov's life </h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong> 1926</strong>: Born into a peasant family in a town on the outskirts of Moscow.
                </li>
              <li>
                <strong> August 1945</strong>: His naval career began with participation in the Soviet-Japanese War aboard a minesweeper.
                </li>
              <li>
                <strong> 1947</strong>: Graduating from the Caspian Higher Naval School, Arkhipov served in the submarine service in the Black Sea, Northern and Baltic Fleets.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong> July 1961</strong>: Newly appointed a deputy commander of a new ballistic missile submarine, K-19, and conducting exercises off the coast of Greenland. The new submarine developed an extreme leak in its nuclear reactor coolant system. The engineering had to work in an extremely radiated environment to create a replacement coolant system and prevent a complete reactor meltdown.
                </li>
              <li>
                <strong> 27th October 1962</strong>: Arkhipov is aboard the diesel-powered, nuclear armed submarine B-59 during the Cuban missile crisis. They are being hunted by a group of 11 United States destroyers near Cuba. Hiding in lower depths from their pursuers, the B-59 was out of contact from Moscow for further instruction for several days. <br>
<br>              
With depth charges rattling their hull and sweltering temperatures owing to a failed air-conditioning system, the submarine's Capatain, Valentin Savitsky, believed they were now at war with their American foes. He ordered a ten kilotonne nuclear torpedo be made ready with the intention to strike the nearby USS Randolph. <br>
<br>
Fortunately, a torpedo launch required the approval of the three officers onboard. Arkhipov was the only officer to refuse. After a fierce argument broke out, Arkhipov was able to persuade Savitsky to calm down, surface the submarine and await contact from Moscow.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong> 1975 </strong> : Continues service after the Cuban missile crisis led to commanding submarines and submarine squadrons. Subsequently, Arkhipov was promoted rear admiral and became the head of the Kirov Naval Academy.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong> 1981 </strong> : Promotion to vice admiral
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong> 1985 </strong> :
                  Retirement from the Navy and settling in Kupavna, Moscow Oblast.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong> 1998 </strong> : Arkhipov dies of kidney cancer at 72, likely caused by the high levels of radiation received during the K-19 accident.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong> 2017 </strong> Arkhipov's daughter, Elena, and grandson, Sergei, collect a posthumous 'Future of Life' award for the submariner's actions that averted nuclear catastrophe.

                "He always thought that he did what he had to do and never considered his actions as heroism. He acted like a man who knew what kind of disasters can come from radiation. He did his part for the future so that everyone can live on our planet."
